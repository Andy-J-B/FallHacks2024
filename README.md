Faster than light yagami.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the popular japanese anime series called Death Note. Bryan created the idea of faster than light yagami which inspired our project.

## What it does

Faster Than Light Yagami is a Godot game that is like a speed typing game. You are trying to type faster than the time limit as the time limit shortens as you progress and the words get harder and longer. There is a leaderboard that (sometimes) works. It also has audio and video clips that enriches the game.

## How we built it

We used Godot.

## Challenges we ran into

All problems we ran into were all based on github. Merging, pulling, pushing errors, and losing files/folders.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our final product and the friendship we made along the way.

## What we learned

We learned to code in Godot, adding videos, audios, button, labels, timers and adding scripts to handle navigation, timers, display, choosing names, etc.

## What's next for Faster Than Light Yagami

Implementing the OCR API to draw letters instead of typing it.
